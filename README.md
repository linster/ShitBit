# ShitBit Analytics
Smart toilet paper roll for the inagural "[YEG Stupid Shit Nobody Needs and Terrible Ideas Hackathon](https://twitter.com/stupidhackyeg)" held on August 20, 2016.

## Tech Stack
The tech stack for this hackathon project was definitely a representative sample of hackathon-quality code :)

* 3 magnets on a paint-roller that holds the TP
* 1 reed switch that is activated when the pait roller rotates 1/3 of a revolution
* 1 Raspberry PI with a python program on it that polls the reed switch, and posts a timestamp to a FireBase server
* A web front-end with graphs that is pushed data from FireBase
* An Android Wear app that notifies you of Toilet Paper Roll activity.... as you're using the TP roll.
